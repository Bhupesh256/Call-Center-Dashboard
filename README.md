# üìû Call Center Performance Dashboard in Excel

An interactive and visually dynamic Excel dashboard project built to analyze call center performance using **Power Pivot**, **DAX**, **PivotTables**, **Slicers**, and **Conditional Formatting**.

## üß† Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **Call Center Performance Dashboard** in Microsoft Excel, showcasing the following core data analytics capabilities:

- Data modeling using **Power Pivot**
- Calculated metrics using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- Interactive filtering with **Slicers**
- Trend analysis using **PivotCharts**
- Real-time performance tracking of customer service representatives
- Advanced **conditional formatting** for better visual storytelling

| Purchase Amount (Sum)            | Total value of purchases resulting from calls                              |
| Average Satisfaction Rating      | Average customer feedback rating (1‚Äì5 scale)                               |
| 5-Star Ratings Count             | Number of calls receiving a perfect satisfaction score                     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. **Data Review & Setup**
- Load and clean call and customer data
- Designate a consistent theme and color scheme
- Prepare icons and images for use in visual layer

### 2. **Modeling & Relationships**
- Add datasets to **Excel Data Model**
- Link `CustomerID` between `Calls` and `Customers` tables

### 3. **Create Measures Using DAX**
- `Total Calls = COUNTROWS(Calls)`
- `Total Purchase = SUM(Calls[Purchase Amount])`
- `Average Rating = AVERAGE(Calls[Satisfaction Rating])`
- `Five Star Ratings = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Calls), Calls[Satisfaction Rating] = 5)`

### 4. **Pivot Tables for Metrics**
- Create base pivot tables for KPIs
- Link slicers for representative and city filtering

### 5. **Build the Dashboard Layout**
- Use shapes, text boxes, and charts to design layout
- Link pivot values to cells for dynamic updates
- Apply conditional formatting to highlight reps or trends

### 6. **Trend Graphs & Visualizations**
- Line/column charts for call trends over time
- Dual-axis charts for comparing calls vs. revenue
- Day-of-week analysis to highlight call patterns

### 7. **Add Representative Insights**
- Insert rep photos and link them to slicer selections
- Display dynamic rep performance using formulas
- Highlight top performers using conditional logic
